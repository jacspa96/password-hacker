### Password Hacker

This repo contains my implementation of project Password Hacker from JetBrains Academy (https://hyperskill.org/projects/80)

### Usage

*Note: Running this project outsite of e-learning platform environment is pointless, as there is no server to connect to and no password to crack.*

To run the program type ```python hack.py {ip_address} {port}```.

Program simulates connecting to the provided server and cracking log-in credentials. 3 cracking techniques were implemented:

* brute force
* dictionary based
* using time-based vulnerability
